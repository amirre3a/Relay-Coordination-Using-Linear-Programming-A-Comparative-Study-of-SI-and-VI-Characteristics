This study presents a linear programming (LP) ap-
proach to determine the optimal Time Multiplier Settings (TMS)
for overcurrent relay coordination. Both Standard Inverse and
Very Inverse relay characteristics are examined. The objective is
to ensure selective operation of main and backup relays while
minimizing operating times. By comparing results under each
characteristic, I analyze the performance in terms of main and
backup relay operation times, offering insights for engineers
selecting appropriate relay curves and settings.
